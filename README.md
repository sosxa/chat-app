# chat-app

currently a work in progress and was privated because I need to add all the api keys and private information into a .env file and also use gitignore to hide the file 

I currently have jsonwebtokens all the routes work well
You can't access the home page without being authenticated and authroized 
the databse secures users properly

I need to design the chat portion and also find a middleware that allows me to use google cloudrive, google firebase, and a noSQL MongoDB all together. If for whatever reason there isn't I can make it more simple 
by removing google OAuth 2.0 and just solely use mongodb making it so users can't login with google but only one database will be used

I'll do nmy best to have it as 2 databases one for google logins one for email users and another for chat logs but if it doesn't work out I won't allow it to eat me alive.

Also been debating on if I want it to be one huge general chat portal or a website where users can chat with specefic users with the email as their username and make groupchats/private chat rooms. 

I plan on finishing this porject early october
